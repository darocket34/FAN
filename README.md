# Friends, Activities, Network

Friends, Activities, Network (F.A.N.) is a social platform that allows people to create and join groups or activities with other like minded individuals. Once signed up, a user can enjoy browsing the list of available groups whether they are local or distant. Both groups and events can be held online or in-person and are labeled as such. Costs for events can be as low as nothing as all or as high as necessary.
